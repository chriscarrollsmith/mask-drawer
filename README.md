# Simple JavaScript Interface for drawing an image mask

I couldn't find a simple boilerplate app to draw an image mask in JavaScript, so I made one.

Currently, it only supports using the 'dog.png' image in the root folder, adding filled circles to the image, and downloading the image.

## How to use

Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/chriscarrollsmith/mask-drawer.git`. Run `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm run dev` to start the server. The app will be available at `localhost:5173`.
